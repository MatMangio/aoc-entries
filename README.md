# Advent of code

This repository holds my entries for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) calendar, divided by year.

I'll try to keep up with it but I'm a university student and I'm involved with many more activities, so please don't mind if my entries will be a tad late sometimes! ^_^'

I'll also try to experiment with as many frameworks and languages as possible, as I believe this can be a great exercise: that said, it follows that my code won't always be optimised or "good" in any sense, so don't take it as reference. Any suggestion is more than welcome though! :D
